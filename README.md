# Automated_Stand
The data analasys for automated SPD measurements. 
SPD is single photon detector. In our realization, this SPD based on SPAD (single photon avalanche photodiode), i.e. on semiconductor sensing element. 
The SPD is useful for QKD (quantum key distribution -- mainly) applications, biomarkers tomography, LIDAR and OTDR systems, deep space exploration etc. 
You can read our articles to better understand the meaning of this device and how it works:

## Navigation
You can run GUI5.py or start_SPD.bat to open the app with 3-D and 2-D representation of measured SPD parameters.
Raw data for different SPD models placed at the !SPDStandResults folder. All our SPD have beautiful names. Inside one of it's name-folder you can see date of the measurement. If u go deeper, you will see raw data and report folder, that contains the postprocessed data in picture and dashbord representation. 

## Updates
Repository updates while adding a new SPD measurements or while adding a new features of the code. So, it's really actual repository.
